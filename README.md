ZeldAlvaro â€” It's a mini-game built for my first project during the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at [Ironhack Madrid](https://www.ironhack.com/).

### Built With:

 This project is built using canvas, javascript and css to build the start menu.

### Getting started:

Use the keyboard arrows to move the player around the screen and the space-bar to attack.

The ghost enemies will move around the screen trying to kill you.

After the number of enemies match the goal, a key will appear.

Once the character takes the key a door will open to win the game.

If your life bar runs out it will be gameover.

### Thank you:
To all my classmates, it's inspiring and fun working among talented people. 
And thank you to the exceptional IronHack team!
